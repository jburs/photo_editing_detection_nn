# photo_editing_detection_nn

photo editing detection using tensor flow neural net. Current accuracy of ~60%, and loss of .66. Next step is hyperparameter tuning to increase accuracy of the model.

dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

To do:
- hyperparameter tuning
- pickle tf model to use in html
- write html page where user can upload image to tf predict
